This page consists of two sections, login and registration

- First part: On the login page, you can fill in the email and password fields and enter the main page if it is correct, or you can use the `Forgot your password?` section. Enter another page and then get your email confirmation and then use the tokens received during registration and then proceed to change the password.

- Second part: On the registration page, you must fill in the email and password and repeat the password until your account is created.
When you create your account, you will be given 5 `tokens` that you can use to change your password.
